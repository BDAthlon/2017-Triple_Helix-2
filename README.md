#Bio Green Globs


Here we make parameter searching fun by creating a game where users can choose whether to simulate data using stochastic or deterministic means and vary parameters in order to create protein plots that hit certain targets, or blobs

The parameters are given in an form ant then the new values for the graph are generated with python. 
The new XY coordinated are passed on to the plotly and the updated graph is plotted on the fly.

The game is written in python and hosted onto a webapp using Flask.

The requirements for the python code are: numpy,scipy,matplotlib,pysces,stochpy


---as you see it is not finished...
