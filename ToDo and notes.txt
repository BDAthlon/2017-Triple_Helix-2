To do list for Ques 2

Diff python files for:

Blob generation function -> random (With a bias? Bias could be part of input). Return image file and dictionary for each blob.

Play the game function -> takes parameters as input, whether stoch or determ, returns the list of coordinates for the plot that gets generated. Must be evenly spaced on xaxis


Scoring function -> Obtain score by seeing if returned list of coordinates varies within a certain amount from blobs. Then plot the blobs (hit blobs in a different colour?) and simulation. 



New game function - generate different blobs - reset button appear after a certain number of tries?


switch for the Stochastic/Deterministic input. See link below.
