To do list for Ques 2

Diff python files for:
Blob generation function -> random (With a bias? Bias could be part of input). Return image file and dictionary for each blob.
Play the game function -> takes parameters as input, whether stoch or determ, returns the list of coordinates for the plot that gets generated. Must be evenly spaced on xaxis
Scoring function -> Obtain score by seeing if returned list of coordinates varies within a certain amount from blobs. Then plot the blobs (hit blobs in a different colour?) and simulation. 
New game function - generate different blobs - reset button appear after a certain number of tries? 

generateblobs.py
game.py
score.py

HEROKU NOTES
the requirements file is not enough. 
the pysces does not like the default numpy version
we would need the one with mkl but that is not listed in the versions avialable through pip

could use a numpy+mkl that is hosted online from here: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ 
the pysces is from here too. 

but that was for windows... not sure what is right for Heroku and how to do that.
